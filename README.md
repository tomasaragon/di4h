# Decision Intelligence 4 Health
Maintained by [Tomás Aragón](https://substack.com/@tomasaragon)

Embedded in all journeys (life, learning, strategy, innovation, etc.) are the choices we make. Since medical school in the 1980s, when I was introduced to the nascent field "decision analysis,"[^1] I came to appreciate that decision making is our most important daily activity. Annie Duke says it best:[^2]

> _"... there are only two things that determine how your life turns out: luck and the quality of your decisions. You have control over only one of those two things."_
>
> _"... your decision-making is the single most important thing you have control over that will help you achieve your goals."
>
> Annie Duke, _How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices_. Penguin Publishing Group, 2020.

In spite of its importance, decision quality is rarely formally taught. This is a shame! Some of reasons include the complex, trans-disciplinary nature of descriptive and normative decision theories.

For public health, Decision Intelligence 4 Health (DI4H) has
- 4 dimensions (decision quality; strategic execution; continuous improvement; and ethics, science, and technology)
- 4 constraint types (values, information, time, and resources),
- 4 competency domains
    - Recognizing and resisting cognitive biases
    - Valuing and applying rationality
    - Thinking probabilistically
    - Structuring decisions
- 4 DEEP decision challenges.
    - Decision making under uncertainty
    - Ethical decision making (moral trade-offs)
    - Emergency and crisis decision making (high stakes with time constraints)
    - Priority setting and resource allocation (budgetary/investment trade-offs)

On this page we focus on learning basic public health decision analysis using popular data science programming languages (Julia, Python, and R).
